# Netlify Provider

The Netlify provider allows you to provision and deploy netlify sites and manage webhooks. The provider needs to be configured with the proper credentials before it can be used.

Use the navigation to the left to read about the available resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
# Configure the Netlify Provider
provider "netlify" {
  token    = "${var.netlify_token}"
  base_url = "${var.netlify_base_url}"
}

# Create a new deploy key for this specific website
resource "netlify_deploy_key" "key" {}

# Define your site
resource "netlify_site" "main" {
  name = "my-site"

  repo {
    repo_branch   = "master"
    command       = "middleman build"
    deploy_key_id = "${netlify_deploy_key.key.id}"
    dir           = "build"
    provider      = "github"
    repo_path     = "username/reponame"
  }
}
```
